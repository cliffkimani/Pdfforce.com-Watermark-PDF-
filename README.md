### Watermark PDF – Add Text or Image Watermarks to Your Documents

The Watermark PDF tool on PDFForce is designed to help you clearly label and protect your documents without altering their content or structure. PDFs are often shared across teams, clients, and platforms, and without clear labeling, important files can be misused, redistributed, or mistaken for final versions.

PDFForce’s Watermark PDF tool allows you to add text or image watermarks directly to your PDF files. Common use cases include marking documents as confidential, draft, internal use only, or adding company branding and ownership information. Watermarks appear consistently across pages, ensuring visibility without disrupting readability.

Watermarking is especially useful when sharing documents externally or distributing review copies. Unlike locking a file, watermarks provide visual control while keeping documents accessible. This makes them ideal for workflows where collaboration is needed but ownership and intent must remain clear.

Watermark PDF is frequently used together with 
[Protect PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/protect) to add both visual and access-based security, 
[Compress PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/compress) to reduce file size before distribution, and 
[Merge PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/merge) when combining multiple documents into a single watermarked file.

For scanned or archived documents, users often apply 
[OCR PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/ocr) before watermarking to ensure text is searchable and reviewable. When documents need reorganization prior to labeling, 
[Split PDF](https://pdfforce.com/tools/split) helps isolate relevant sections before applying watermarks.

Watermark PDF on PDFForce is built for professionals, businesses, educators, and teams who need a simple way to assert ownership, clarify document status, and reduce misuse. Whether you are sharing drafts, branded materials, or sensitive documents, watermarks provide a clear and effective layer of control.
